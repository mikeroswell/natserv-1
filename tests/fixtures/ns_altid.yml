        <i>Hydrastis canadensis, </i>an herbaceous understory species of the eastern
        deciduous forest, with the core of its range in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and
        West Virginia (Sinclair and Catling 2000a).  It extends north into Ontario,
        Canada and as far south in the United States to Alabama, east to North Carolina
        and north to Vermont.<br /><br />Goldenseal may be best known for its use
        as an herbal supplement for a variety of health purposes, including as an
        immune booster and anti-inflammatory agent.  Its earliest known use was by
        indigenous people in the eastern North America and by the 1700s it was used
        as a digestion aid and treatment for skin imflammation (Barton 1798).   Its
        use is well documented from the 1800s to the present, with increasing demand
        through time as markets expanded beyond local usage.  The species has been
        primarily wild-harvested, and over-collection of the plant is a predominate
        threat.<br /><br />Concern due to over-collection is expressed at the national
        levels both in the United States and Canada. Since 1997, goldenseal has been
        listed in Appendix II of the Convention for International Trade on Endangered
        Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to regulate international trade to
        ensure there is no detriment to the survival of the species in the wild.  The
        CITES Appendix II listing requires that exporters obtain CITES permits or
        certificates for international export of whole, parts and powdered roots and
        rhizomes of goldenseal. In Canada, goldenseal is listed as Threatened on Schedule
        I of the federal Species at Risk Act. <br /><br />Long-term decline since
        the beginning of its harvest history is evident, and short term trends are
        more localized, from declining to stable.  State conservation statuses range
        from vulnerable to critically imperiled in the periphery of the range, to
        uncommon and secure in the core of its range.  As of 2013, the species is
        state-listed as endangered, vulnerable or threatened in at least ten states.  Seven
        of the states within goldenseal''s range do not have State plant endangered
        species lists or protection laws.  <br /><br />Goldenseal, from a rangewide
        perspective and in a classical perspective of distribution and abundance is
        currently uncommon to secure, however, from a more holistic conservation perspective
        the extent of threats, long-term trends and short-term trends demand continuous
        and close monitoring in both the United States and Canada.","rankInfo":{"elementGlobalId":154701,"aooPercentGood":null,"enviromentalSpecificity":{"id":8,"enviromentalSpecificityDescEn":"Moderate.  Generalist

        are typically between several stems to several hundred ramets (i.e. vegetative
        stems emerging from one parental plant) (Sanders and McGraw 2005, Sinclair
        and Catling 2000, Mulligan and Gorchov 2004).  In Ohio, it is estimated that
        62% of populations contain fewer than 200 ramets, 10% had between 200 and
        1,000 ramets and 28% had more than 1,000 ramets (Mulligan and Gorchov 2004).  The
        majority of populations in Ohio are small.  <br />Research in West Virginia,
        one of the core range states, on larger-scale habitat requirements, or mesotopographic
        distribution patterns, found patches of goldenseal to be very diffuse across
        the landscape (McGraw et al. 2005).","viabilityComments":null,"threatImpactComments":"<i>Hydrastis
        canadensis, </i>Goldenseal, a medicinal herb, is threatened primarily by removal
        of habitat, decline in habitat quality, wild-collection and deer browsing.<br
        /><br />Habitat destruction is a primary threat throughout its range, as reported
        by Sinclair and Catling (2000a) only 5% of forested habitat that supports
        goldenseal in Canada remains, in many personal communications with Natural
        Heritage Botanists in 2012 and throughout New England (Tait 2006). It is surmised
        that local extinctions in Ohio were the result of urban sprawl (Mulligan and
        Gorchov 2004). The interaction and compounding intensification of over-collection
        and habitat loss, should not be overlooked. Albrecht and McCarthy (2006) suggest
        that observations by botanists of population disappearance in the early 19th
        century documented this co-occurrence of threats. It is also suggested that
        the combination of these two threats may reduce or reverse positive efforts
        of stewardship, or ''managed'' populations (Albrecht and McCarthy 2006). It
        should also be recognized that the combined interaction of these threats may
        be increasing the rate of decline in areas of its range where these two threats
        are actively occurring.<br /><br /><br />Goldenseal has been cultivated for
        100+ years throughout its range and historically most of the trade domestically
        and internationally comes from wild harvested plants (Christensen and Gorchov
        2010). In recent years there has been an apparent shift. The CITES Trade Database
        (200-2013) indicates that much of the material in international trade, and
        all in 2003, which is legal is from cultivated plants. The market for goldenseal
        is expected to grow at a rate of 5% to 10% annually, and the market for high
        quality cultivated material is expected to grow 10 to 15% annually (Greenfield
        and David 2012).<br /><br />Cultivated goldenseal makes p a large portion
        of domestic trade according to the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA),
        however, the amount of wild-harvested rhizome that is collected and traded
        in the United States is unknown. In Indiana, collection pressure has intensified
        dramatically over the last 10 years, based on the number of inquiries by herbal
        diggers in the state (pers. comm. Indiana Department of Natural Resources).
        Along with the increased demand for goldenseal in Indiana, according to State
        officials, it is evident that herbal diggers that are harvesting wild goldenseal
        in July and August are also harvesting American ginseng (<i>Panax quinquefolius)</i>
        outside the legal harvest season that has not yet had a chance to reproduce
        (pers. comm. Indiana Department of Natural Resources). Law enforcement officials
        in Indiana are concerned for the species due to the amount being shipped from
        the state, and while there are no quantitative data on population declines
        in Indiana (pers. comm. Indiana Department of Natural Resources), declines
        seem likely. Collection pressure in parts of the species'' range where unemployment
        is high is incentivized by prices paid for wild-collected roots/rhizomes in
        the herbal market (McGraw et al. 2003). Studies suggest that if as little
        as 10% of the plants from a population are removed by collected annually,
        that the population will go extinct over time (Mulligan and Gorchov 2004).<br
        /><br />Invasive species is also a threat, including pressure from both non-native
        plants. White-tailed deer browse is also a threat in Ohio (Mulligan and Gorchov
        2004) and in other parts of the range.<br /><br />Further threats as noted
        by state Natural Heritage Botanists:<br />Alabama: Incompatible forestry practices
        appear to be the foremost concern, with invasive species of secondary importance
        (Al Schotz, pers. comm., 2012).<br />Arkansas: Unknown (Theo Witsell, pers.
        comm., 2012).<br />Connecticut: Invasive species and canopy closure. Severity
        of the threats is unknown (Nelson DeBarros &amp; Nancy Murray, pers. comm.,
        2012).<br />Delaware: Invasive species and deer browse (William A. McAvoy,
        pers. comm., 2012).<br />Indiana: Not known, but collecting and habitat destruction
        likely (Michael Homoya, pers. comm., 2012).<br />Kansas: Unknown (Craig C.
        Freeman, pers. comm., 2012).<br />Kentucky: The current threats are land conversion/development,
        collection, and high deer populations (Deborah White, pers. comm., 2012).<br
        />Massachusetts: This plant has never been common in Massachusetts, populations
        are very small and threatened by herbivory (Bryan Connolly, pers. comm., 2012)<br
        />Michigan: Collecting and habitat destruction (M.R. Penskar et al. 2001).<br
        />Minnesota: Invasive species (such as garlic mustard and buckthorn) continue
        to be discovered in the greater area of goldenseal''s range in Minnesota.
        This will likely be a rising threat to populations in the long-term (Derek
        Anderson, Welby Smith, &amp; Nancy Sather, pers. comm., 2012).<br />Missouri:
        Current threats are over harvesting, particularly on public land. (Malissa
        Underwood, pers. comm., 2012).<br />Mississippi: In the Loess Bluff Physiographic
        Province, rapid subdivision development is encroaching into the habitat of
        goldenseal. One population has already probably been extirpated by a \"Loess
        Bluff Restoration Project\" associated with a housing development. In the
        Pontotoc Ridge Physiographic Province, the private land owner is considering
        developing the land as a new subdivision(Heather Sullivan, pers. comm., 2012).<br
        />New York: It is collected for medicinal purposes but so far there is no

        &amp; Aaron Marcus, pers. comm., 2012).<br />Wisconsin: Forest conversion
        is likely the largest historical threat. Forest fragmentation and development
        is likely the largest current threat with invasive plants and earthworm likely
        causing significant impacts, especially for spread by seed. Leaf herbivory
        is unknown, but deer populations are high in the known region. Fruit herbivory
        and seed destruction is also unknown, but turkeys and rodents may be causing
        destruction of seed or placement in inappropriate habitat. Possible threats
        by logging, although the level of logging in the southern part of the state
        where it is found is relatively low, especially in the southeast. Impacts
        of harvest are unknown. We do not receive any harvest data and reports of
        sales to ginseng dealers is erratic. It would be fairly simple to survey ginseng
        dealers and ask them about amounts and trends in goldenseal harvest. Dealers
        may also have a sense if it is generally being harvested sustainably. (Kevin

        of <i>Hydrastis canadensis </i>is wild-collected for medicinal uses.  Short
        term trend information is available from a few sources. There is decline in
        some populations due to wild-collection and habitat loss. Wild-collection
        in Canada is prohibited.  Overall population decline is evidenced through
        fewer populations present, fewer patches per population, and fewer ramets
        per patch (Sanders and McGraw 2005). Rangewide, or state-by-state, abundance
        information for goldenseal is unknown, which is typical of most wild-harvested
        plant species (McGraw et al. 2003).  Abundance and short-term trends in the
        core range states, in terms of both population size (numbers) and patches,
        is not available because it is not state-protected, and hence not monitored
        closely.  There are studies and observations for a few jurisdictions.<br /><br
        />Canada:<br />Population studies in Ontario, Canada detected no declines
        between 1991 and 1998.  Some patches may have been increasing while others
        were decreasing (Sinclair and Catling 2000a).  The rate of expansion over
        several decades in Ontario is considered slight and slow, and possibly because
        of lack of disturbance given that populations in areas with some disturbance
        (greater light and nutrient resources) had highly variable growth rates (Sinclair
        and Catling 2002).<br /><br />United States:<br />In West Virginia, evidence
        of poaching was documented near Morgantown, West Virginia (Sanders and McGraw
        2005), however, it is widely known that the rhizome is collected for trade
        in the medicinal market.  <br /><br />In Ohio, a core range state, recent
        short-term declines of approximately 30% were detected in goldenseal (Mulligan
        and Gorchov 2004, pers. comm. Gorchov 2012). Of 42 sites documented in Ohio
        from 1977-1998, 14 of these were extirpated as of 2002, if the rate of decline
        is constant, approximately 1.6% of populations are expected to be extirpated
        each year, and approximately a 30% decline over 20 years (Mulligan and Gorchov
        2004, pers. comm. Gorchov 2012). <br /><br />In New York, recent studies have
        shown on-going extirpations as the distribution was reduced from 14 counties
        to 12 counties, due to habitat loss (Tait 2006).<br /><br />In Indiana, another
        core-range state, a dramatic increase in the amount of goldenseal harvested
        over the past 10 years has occurred, and law enforcement officials have expressed
        concern for the species due to the tonnage being shipped from the state (pers.
        comm. Indiana Department of Natural Resources).  Even though quantitative
        information about trends in Indiana do not exist, sharp increases in collection
        over 10 years suggest that a decline is very likely in this slow growing perennial.  A
        study described the growth rate of goldenseal as ''slight'' (Sinclair and
        Catling 2000a).<br /><br />Some information about short-term trends is available
        from state Natural Heritage botanists.  Alabama (pers. comm. A. Schotz 2012)
        and Ohio (pers. comm. R. Gardner 2012) have had short term declines and West
        Virginia (pers. comm. P. Harmon) may also have short term declines. Botanists
        from the following states; AR, DE, KY, MO, MS, NC, NY, PA, TN, and VT say
        that the species is stable to slightly declining in their state.","longTermTrendComments":"Since
        the mid 1800s, populations throughout goldenseal''s range have dramatically
        declined due to collection for medicinal uses and habitat destruction (Mulligan
        and Gorchov 2004).  There is anecdotal evidence that during the 19th century
        as botanists noticed the decline and loss of goldenseal populations because
        of market demand and loss of habitat, greater pressure on managed or previously
        unharvested populations intensified (Albrecht and McCarthy 2006).  Once-abundant
        populations were decimated, and the distribution of this widespread species
        was reduced to isolated, scattered patches (Mulligan and Gorchov 2004, CITES
        1991, Lloyd and Lloyd 1884-1885 in Foster 1991, Henkel and Klugh 1904).<br
        /><br />Loss of habitat is another primary threat both in United States (Tait
        2006) and Canada (Sinclair and Catling 2000a).  There are only remnants of
        the woodlands remaining where this species occurs in Canada: less than 5%
        of these forests remain from presettlement times (Sinclair and Catling 2000a).  Similarly,
        in New England during the 1800s, forest conversion, from forested lands to
        agriculture and settlement, reached its height and approximately 80% of the
        originally forested land was lost (Tait 2006).  In addition, many Ohio populations
        have gone extinct (Christensen and Gorchov 2010).  A study by Mulligan and
        Gorchov (2004) assessed the status of 71 historical locations of goldenseal
        in Ohio and concluded that nearly half of the populations had been extirpated
        (13% of the extinctions were due to habitat destruction).  They note that
        this number may be somewhat mitigated by the rate of colonization, however,
        that is unknown.<br /><br />Finally, according to the proposal to list goldenseal
        in Appendix II of CITES (1997),  \"the decline to rarity of this species has
        been reiterated by numerous authors including Millspaugh 1887, Henkel and

        habitat loss, are having on the populations. States that actively track this
        species should search areas of potential habitat. Populations should be monitored
        for the presence of the leaf blight which is threatening the population in

        regulations protecting plants on public and protected lands need greater enforcement.
        <br /><br />Removal from state protected list occurred in North Carolina,
        in December 2010. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer
        Services Plant Conservation Board removed goldenseal from the protected plant
        list (Greenfield and Davis 2012).  There are no state restrictions on harvesting
        or cultivating in the state.  Within the state, however, permits to collect
        the plants on federal forests will not be granted (Greenfield and Davis 2012).","protectionNeeds":"Plants
        on public and protected lands need greater protection from legal and illegal

        to collect in late-summer and fall as the plant is going dormant. This may
        maximize harvesting returns and minimize collection and threats to the plant
        because a) rhizomes are bigger inthe fall than in the early part of the growing
        season and b) more rhizomes moisture content is lower in the fall so fewer
        rhizomes need to be collected to equal the fresh:dry weight ration of rhizomes
        collected in the spring (Albrecht and McCarthy 2006).  These observations
        could be used to guide permitting by state governments.","otherConsiderations":"Random
        amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, using samples from both wild and
        cultivated populations in North Carolina (cultivated), Ohio (cultivated),
        Pennsylvania (wild) and West Virginia (wild), showed that most genetic variation
        was found within groups and among samples within populations, but not between
        the wild and cultivated groups (Kelley 2009).  Moderate to high levels of
        genetic variation were found within both the wild and cultivated groups (F-statistic
        = 0.738, within populations) (Kelley 2009).  What is important to note, however,
        is that Kelley (2009) found that some populations had very low genetic diversity
        suggesting that these wild populations were not frequently reproducing sexually,
        and expanding vegetatively.  This is not surprising since it is widely known
        that it is clonal.  Another genetic study in 2012 examining genetic diversity
        of 6 population in western North Carolina found that most genetic variation
        was within populations, but that overall all genetic and allelic diversity
        was low among populations suggesting that outbreeding depression would be
        an unlikely effect from replanting declining populations in North Carolina
        (Torgerson 2012).","intrinsicVulnerabilityComments":"Primarily a clonal species
        with low seed to ramet production, but with some or few seedlings advancing
        to higher life stages allowing for at least infrequent infusion of genetic
        diversity into populations via sexual reproduction by seed.  It takes between
        four and five years for a plant to reach sexual maturity, i.e. the point at
        which it produces flowers.  Seedlings successfully moving forward to the next
        life-stages may be dependent on geographic location within its range, since
        in Ontario seedlings were rarely observed while in Ohio seedlings were still
        low in number but not rare (Sinclair and Catling 2000, Christensen and Gorchov
        2010).<br /><br />Sexual reproduction contributes less to population growth
        due to low survival of seedlings: only 36% of seedlings made it to yr 2 and
        only 54% of these made it to yr 3, but new ramets had a 73% survival rate
        to the second year (Christensen and Gorchov 2010).  Further inbreeding is
        not expected in goldenseal since it produces ramets and flowers, and is self-compatible
        (Sinclair et al. 2000, Sanders and McGraw 2003, Christensen and Gorchov 2010,
        Mulligan and Gorchov 2004).<br /><br />In terms of population growth rate,
        Sinclair and Catling (2002) describe goldenseal''s growth rate in non-harvested
        populations, at the northern limit of its range as slight and slow.  Studies
        in West Virginia examining its recovery from harvest, show an initial surge
        in growth (increased stem number), but that few plants progressed from one
        life history stage to the next in following years (Van der Voort et al. 2003).  This
        is exemplified by results in Sanders and McGraw (2005), who examined growth
        response to harvest.  Sanders and McGraw (2005) found that ramet leaf area
        recovered only 34% of the orginal pre-harvested leaf-area after 2 years [leaf
        area in the sampling plots from year 1 to year 2 was a measure of growth and

        roots, plants, leaves, seeds, fruits and whole plants are sold in many forms:
        powdered, dried or fresh (Egert 2007). Two parts of the goldenseal plant are
        used for medicinal purposes: the rhizomes and leaves (or aerial parts). Rhizomes
        seem to be the preferred target for harvest because goldenseal rhizomes have
        the highest concentration of medicinally-active alkaloids, berberine, hydrastine
        and canadine. Leaves and stems contain lower levels of these alkaloids (Douglas
        et al. 2010).<br /><br />Studies have found that goldenseal performs well
        as a yeast inhibitor, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, bile stimulant, and immune
        system stimulant (Bradley 1992, Benigni et al. 1962, Liu 1991, Kaneda 1991,
        Murray 1995, Sun 1988, Sack 1982). These properties help cure mouth and gum
        disorders, eye afflictions, infected wounds, bacterial or fungal infections,
        diarrhea, vaginitis, food poisoning, giardia, cholera, and dermatitis (e.g.
        Mills 1991, Murray 1995, Amalaradjou &amp; Venkitanarayanan 2011). In a survey
        of AIDS/HIV patients, goldenseal was one of the products most purchased, and
        most recommended by health-store employees (Medical Sciences Bulletin 1995).<br
        /><br />Studies in medical journals focused on the interaction of goldenseal
        with other drugs (Guo et al. 2011, Chatuphonprasert 2012, Shi &amp; Klotz
        2012, Gurley et al. 2012, Zadoyan &amp; Fuhr 2012, and Yamaura et al. 2012)
        and its chemical makeup (Le et al. 2012). There is evidence of the effectiveness
        of it treating mycoplasmosis (Arjoon 2012), H1N1 influenza A virus (Cecil
        et al. 2011), cancer (Karmakar et al. 2010 and Kim et al. 2010), and growth
        inhibition of MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>)(Cech
        et al. 2012).<br /><br />The American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) is
        a trade association with over 200 herbal companies as members. AHPA surveys
        their members annually and goldenseal tonnage reports are based on these surveys
        (from up to 10 companies). Between 21 and 63 tons of dried rhizome and 0.1-10
        tons of fresh wild rhizome were harvested each year from 2000-2010. In 1998,
        the AHPA recorded only 2% from cultivated sources, and this percentage increased
        to17-41% between 2000 - 2010. AHPA members increased procurement of cultivated
        goldenseal by 2-17% from 1998-2010 (Dentali &amp; Zimmerman 2012). AHPA (2012)
        reported in that timeframe that 21,500 kg of the total 255,000 kg harvested
        were exported internationally. Since, 2003 all US exports (including roots,
        powder, and derivatives) are from cultivated sources according to the CITES
        trade database (2013).<br /><br />As with other medicinal plants, the \"problem\"
        with cultivating goldenseal is that you have to wait several years to get
        a product. There are two methods for cultivating goldenseal: woods-cultivated
        and wild-simulated. Woods/forest cultivated methods require less investment,
        but profit earnings are unpredictable. Burkhart and Jacobson (2009) indicated
        that cultivating goldenseal in a forest was not profitable at a historics
        price of $20/pound because of the annual production cost over the multiple
        years required before harvest. However, if has been suggested that organic
        certification may be a viable option to increase profitability of cultivated
        goldenseal (Burkhart and Jacobson 2009).<br /><br />The price for rhizomes
        increased from the $5/lb in the 1970s to $40/lb in the late 1990s and early
        2000s, with a downturn in 2005 when growers and wild harvesters earned about
        $15/lb. The price per pound for leaves consistently averages half that of
        the rhizomes (PA DCNR 2012). In 2010, organic goldenseal farmers were earning
        $40/lb for rhizomes (Baker 2010). Recent information indicates that cultivated
        goldenseal may be garnering a higher price than wild goldenseal, with cultivated
        root selling for $30-35/dried pound and wild material selling for $20-25/pound
        (David and Greenfield 2012).","plantProductionMethods":[{"plantCagProdMethodId":100091,"productionMethod":{"id":2,"productionMethodDescEn":"Cultivated","productionMethodDescEs":null,"productionMethodDescFr":"Cultivé"}},{"plantCagProdMethodId":100090,"productionMethod":{"id":1,"productionMethodDescEn":"Wild-harvested","productionMethodDescEs":null,"productionMethodDescFr":"Récolté

        should be monitored for impacts related to harvest, and wild-collection is
        a primary threat to this species.  Most populations of goldenseal are made-up
        of 1000 and fewer stems, and while populations may be small protecting even
        the smallest should be considered.  Goldenseal maintains a mixed-breeding
        system and is able to self-pollinate to produce fruit, as well as produce
        sterile stems (non-flowering) that are genetically identical to other stems
        in the same patch (Christensen and Gorchov 2010, Sanders 2004).  Since goldenseal
        is capable of self-pollination to set fruit, even small populations can be
        long-lived, and can act as sources of genetic variability for other nearby
        populations (Sanders 2004).  Further, populations in small areas should be
        considered for conservation based on research that showed that goldenseal
        responds favorably to light and soil disturbance, and larger populations were
        associated with small habitat area (Sinclair and Catling 200b).  A genetic
        study in North Carolina showed that while higher levels of genetic diversity
        were measured within populations, that genetic and allelic diversity was low
        across populations suggesting that reintroductions into populations would
        not likely cause outbreeding depression (Torgerson 2012). <br><br>Studies
        show that the best measure of past collection is the number of fertile (Sinclair
        and Catling 2000, Christensen and Gorchov 2010) and large sterile plants (Christensen
        and Gorchov 2010) from year to year, as these two life classes are responsible
        for maintaining or proliferating population size.<br><br>Data collection on
        environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation and soil nutrients
        should be maintained over the life of any monitoring program.  Buds for next
        year''s stems are formed in summer or fall (Sinclair and Catling 2000) and
        spring growth is likely linked with the size of the flower bud and a determiner
        of whether plants will reproduce vegetatively or sexually in a given year
        (Christensen and Gorchov 2010). Growth is dependent on precipitation and temperature,
        and in one study high levels of soil nutrients (especially phosphorus) promoted
        growth of young stems (Sinclair and Catling 2000).<br><br>Other data related
        to the habitat should also be collected, such as percent canopy cover and
        soil displacement by animals and uprooted trees since goldenseal positively
        responds to mild disturbance, particularly light gaps and some soil disturbance
        (McGraw et al. 2003).  Management and monitoring of patches should be done
        based on changes in leaf-area from year to year, and not stem count.  Results
        from illicitly harvested patches in West Virginia show that leaf-area was
        immediately and negatively affected compared to pre-harvest leaf-area, and
        that stem-counts do not clearly relate to pre-harvest numbers (Sanders and
        McGraw 2005).  Finally, if populations are harvested, the time of year this
        takes place should be noted.  Albrecht and McCarthy (2006) found that fall-harvested
        populations may recover faster than those harvested in the mid-summer.<br><br>Success
        in monitoring and managing population dynamics is dependent on the knowledge
        of the data collectors and program managers, since understanding the reproductive
        life history of this plant is critical (i.e. it is known that large sterile
        (non-flowerig) plants transition back and forth from fertile plants) for accurate
        tracking of population health and viability.  Further, managers should know
        the local phenology pattern of the plant from emergence to senescence.  Detailed
        information about the life history of goldenseal is available in Christensen
        and Gorchov (2010), general biology and complexities associated with management
        are provided in Sinclair and Catling (2000), and diagram of the root (used
        in medicinal compounds) available in Van der Voort et al. (2003).","impacts":null,"restorationPotential":null,"siteConservationPlansConsidered":null,"managementMethods":null,"monitoringMethods":null,"managementProgramContacts":null,"monitoringProgramContacts":null,"managementResearchPrograms":null,"managementResearchNeeds":null,"biologicalResearchNeeds":"Few
        studies have been conducted on the genetic diversity of the species.  Random
        amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed that moderate to high genetic
        diversity was found in wild populations sampled in Pennsylvania and West Virginia,
        but that some populations had very low genetic diversity suggesting they are
        reproducing vegetatively (Kelley 2009). One other study examined 6 goldenseal
        locations in North Carolina and found that most genetic variation was found
        within populations, however, genetic diversity across populations was found
        to be low (Torgerson 2012).  Torgerson (2012) notes that because genetic and
        allelic diversity was low across all of the goldenseal populations researched
        in North Carolina, that reintroductions into declining populations should
        not cause genetic loss through oubreeding depression.  Similar studies in
        other states in the core range states would further help inform stewardship
        practices such as reintroductions in harvested populations.  Genetic studies
        are also needed to examine the consequences of climate change if low genetic
        levels are detected along the leading or trailing edges of its range.   Genetic
        diversity should also be considered when developing stewardship programs focused
        on responsible harvesting.<br /><br />Patterns of rhizome collection need
        to be documented to better understand the proportion of size classes that
        harvesters remove, and how goldenseal responds to these different patterns
        (pers. comm. Gorchov 2012).  In other words, the frequency, intensity and
        technique of harvesting patterns needs monitoring, in addition to its re-growth
        response (Albrecht and McCarthy 2006).<br /><br />Modeling is also a need.  Models
        that project the impact of harvesting based on the different proportions of
        life history classes collected and at different time intervals are needed
        (pers. comm. Gorchov 2012).  Models that use real-life harvesting practices
        could be intrumental in documenting and predicting the decline of goldenseal,
        and decline is a vital component to assessing extinction risk for this clonal
        species.<br /><br />The extent of impact of deer browse on patches throughout
        goldenseal''s range is needed (pers. comm. Gorchov 2012).  Many states record
        that white-tailed deer herbivory is a threat, however, the extent of the threat
        is not well understood.<br /><br />Lastly, there are a number of questions
        relating to the economic trade that need research.  It is not clear what percentage
        of wild harvested goldenseal is used domestically.  It is not clear what the
        harvest or cultivation practices are of herbal companies that do not belong
        to AHPA (American Herbal Products Association). It is also not clear if this
        is offsetting collection pressure from wild populations of goldenseal, given
        that some states continue to report declines, and to what extent poaching
        is impacting wild populations.  More research is required to determine whether
        current goldenseal demands can be satisfied by increased cultivation and whether
        market prices might stabilize if there are potentially stable supplies of
        goldenseal.","additionalTopics":null},"occurrenceViability":{"elementGlobalId":154701,"eoSpecGroupName":null,"excellentViability":null,"goodViability":null,"fairViability":null,"poorViability":null,"viabilityJustification":null,"versionDate":null,"versionAuthor":null,"versionNotes":null},"references":[{"id":715921,"citation":"Marcus,

        reproduces both clonally and sexually, with clonal division more frequent
        than asexual reproduction. It takes between 4 and 5 years for a plant to reach
        sexual maturity, i.e. the point at which it produces flowers. Plants in the
        first stage, when the seed erupts and cotyledons emerge, can remain in this
        state one or more years. The second vegetative stage occurs during years two
        and three (and sometimes longer) and is characterized by the development of
        a single leaf and absence of a well developed stem. Finally, the third stage
        is reproductive, at which point flowering and fruiting occurs. This last stage
        takes between 4 and 5 years to develop (Burkhart and Jacobson 2006).<br /><br
        />Flowers in April through May, and fruits from June through July (Eichenberger
        and Parker 1976, Sinclair et al. 2000). Fruit and seed set is not dependent
        on cross-pollination because Goldenseal has a mixed-mating system and flowers
        show similar fruit set whether or not pollinators were excluded (Sanders 2004,
        Christensen and Gorchov 2010).<br />In the northern reaches of goldenseal''s
        range, in southwest Ontario, seedlings are rare (Sinclair and Catling 2000a).
        A study in the core portion of the range, in Ohio, found that while seedlings
        were far fewer than ramets, a ''substantial'' number of the seedling-minority
        made it to the next life history stage, and ultimately represents an infusion
        of genetic diversity into the otherwise highly clonal population (Christensen
        and Gorchov 2010).<br />Christensen and Gorchov (2010) noted the following
        that seedling rarity is not due to: a) infrequent flowering, low fruit or
        seed set, and low seed viability.<br /><br />Christensen and Gorchov (2010)

        the United States goldenseal is found in rich, densely shaded, deciduous forests
        with good air flow and water drainage (Greenfield and Davis 2012). Light gaps
        and soil disturbance stimulate local proliferation (McGraw et al. 2003).<br
        /><br />Canada: In Southwest Ontario goldenseal is limited to deciduous woodlands
        near floodplains and periodic spring-flooded plateaus. There only remnants
        of this woodland remains, less than 5%of these forests remain from pre-settlement
        times (Sinclair and Catling 2000).<br /><br />Goldenseal grows best in rich,
        mesic hardwood forest, especially those underlain by limestone or alkaline
        soils, butis also known from slightly acidic soils too. These forests are
        often second growth forests with the following associates (listed alphabetically

        vary considerable from region to region, but some of the above associates
        are likely to be found. Areas with <i>Hydrastis</i> also tend to have a nice
        collection of spring wildflowers and fern diversity is also likely higher
        than surrounding areas.","generalDescription":"Goldenseal is a perennial plant
        that grows from stems one to two feet high. Plants with single leaves produce
        no flowers and plants with two leaves produce flowers (Van der Voort et al.
        2003). The flowers are greenish-white, made up of three sepals and many stamens
        and carpels which emerge in April or May. Fruits ripen between July and August.
        Goldeneal produces a rhizome with many adventitious roots emerging from it.
        The rhizome is yellowish, growing horizontally, is knotty and grows between
        4-7cm long and between 0.5-2cm in width (Sinclair and Catling 2000a).","diagnosticCharacteristics":null,"speciesMarineHabitats":[],"speciesTerrestrialHabitats":[{"cagTerrHabId":109257,"terrestrialHabitat":{"id":1,"terrestrialHabitatDescEn":"Forest
