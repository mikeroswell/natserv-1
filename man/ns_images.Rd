\usage{
ns_images(
  uid = NULL,
  scientificName = NULL,
  commonName = NULL,
  includeSynonyms = NULL,
  resolution = NULL,
  ITISNames = NULL,
  key = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{(character) a species UID, e.g., ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.100925}

\item{scientificName}{(character) An asterisk (\emph{) wildcarded species
scientific name, e.g., 'Aquila chry}'. Name matching is case-insensitive.}

\item{commonName}{(character) An asterisk (\emph{) wildcarded species common
name, e.g., 'g}EAGLE'. Name matching is case-insensitive.}

\item{includeSynonyms}{(character)    An optional parameter, relevant to
scientific or common name queries, that indicates whether to include
synonymous names in the query, as follows:
\itemize{
\item Y (or y) - search the Primary and all synonymous Scientific and
Common Names
\item Any other value, or omitted - search only the Primary Scientific
and Common Name fields
}}

\item{resolution}{(character)    An optional parameter that restricts output
to images at a certain resolution. The value can be of one of the following.
\itemize{
\item lowest - return only the lowest resolution version of images
\item highest - return only the highest resolution version of images
\item thumbnail - return only the version NatureServe deems the
'thumbnail image'
\item web - return only the version NatureServe deems the 'web image'
}

The omission of this parameter leads to the return of metadata for images at
all available resolutions.}

\item{ITISNames}{(character)    An optional parameter, relevant to scientific
or common name queries, that will indicate whether to restrict queries to
ITIS names, as follows.
\itemize{
\item Y (or y) - query using ITIS names
\item Any other value, or omitted - query using NatureServe names
}

NOTE: This parameter is a placeholder only and will not affect processing.
At present, searching by ITIS names is not possible.}

\item{key}{(character) API key. Required. See \strong{Authentication} below
for more.}

\item{...}{Curl options passed on to \code{\link[crul]{HttpClient}}}

a list with terms and images

Note that the NatureServer servers apparently want Windows
HTML encoding (Windows-1252), instead of UTF-8, so some accents
and such may not work

Get an API key from NatureServe at
\url{https://services.natureserve.org/developer/index.jsp}.
You can pass your token in as an argument or store it one of two places:

\itemize{
\item your .Rprofile file with an entry like
\code{options(NatureServeKey = "your-natureserve-key")}
\item your .Renviron file with an entry like
\code{NATURE_SERVE_KEY=your-natureserve-key}
}

See \code{\link{Startup}} for information on how to create/find your
.Rrofile and .Renviron files
}

\dontrun{
# search by uid
ns_images(uid = 'ELEMENT_GLOBAL.2.100925')

# search by common name and resolutio thumbnail
(res <- ns_images(commonName = "*eagle", resolution = 'thumbnail'))

# search "Ruby*", all common names [in any language], and highest
# resolution only:
(res <- ns_images(commonName = "Ruby*", includeSynonyms = 'y',
  resolution = 'highest'))
