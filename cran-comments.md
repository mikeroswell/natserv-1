0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 1 reverse dependency. (Summary at <https://github.com/ropensci/natserv/blob/master/revdep/README.md>). There is a problem 
caused with the 1 dependency (taxize) because of function name changes in this version; a new release of taxize will follow shortly after this one.

---

This version improves changes all exported functions following release of a new API by NatureServe.

Thanks!
