`natserv` NatureServe R client

NatureServe is a non-profit organization that provides wildlife conservation related data to various groups including the public.

* NatureServe site: https://services.natureserve.org
* NatureServe API docs: https://explorer.natureserve.org/api-docs/

All functions in this package are prefixed with `ns_` to prevent
collision with other pkgs.

Three NatureServe web services are available in this package:

* Name lookup (`ns_search`) lookup species Unique IDs (UID) by name. These UIDs are required for access to the more detailed services.
* Image lookup (`ns_images`) search for metadata for NatureServe images, including the URL's for the image files themselves.
* Fetch data (`ns_data`) on over 70,000 of the plant and animal species of the United States and Canada.

You'll need an API key to use this package. Get one by signing up at
https://services.natureserve.org/developer/index.jsp

See also the taxize book (https://taxize.dev/) for 
a manual on working with taxonomic data in R, including with NatureServe data.
